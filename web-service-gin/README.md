# Gin Web Server

This is a very basic RESTful API using the [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/).

Currently, it supports GET and POST requests using cURL.

The project was made using this [Tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin) on the [go.dev](https://go.dev/) website.
